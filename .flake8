[flake8]
#  • Don’t break pipelines on lint failures:
exit-zero = True

#  • Show the source line for each violation:
show-source = True

#  • Print a summary of counts by code:
statistics = True

#  • Customize which error/warning codes you *don’t* care about:
#    E203, W503 are common conflicts with black; adjust as you like.
ignore =
    E302,
    E306,
    E501,

#  • Or selectively enforce only certain codes:
#select = C,E,F,W,B,B950

#  • Extend default max line length (if needed):
#max-line-length = 100

#  • Per-file ignores (e.g., allow test files to be a little sloppier):
#per-file-ignores =
#    tests/*: D, E501
